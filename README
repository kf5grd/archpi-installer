Attention!
----------
Files get_wpa and get_wpa.service are copied to the sd card by the script. These
files are not to be run as part of this package, and must not be removed in order
for this script to function properly.

The scripts outlined below expect your sd card to be plugged in, but not mounted.
These scripts WILL cause you to lose data if you enter the wrong drive, so be
very careful to ensure that you're entering the correct drive for your pi's sd card.

Use these scripts at your own risk.

=================================================================================

Usage:
------
If you have already installed arch on the sd card and only want to install the auto
wpa scripts, run the following (assuming your sd card is at /dev/sdb):

./arch-auto-wpa.sh /dev/sdb

If you want to format your sd card and install arch from scratch, including the auto
wpa scripts, run the following (assuming your sd card is at /dev/sdb, and your arch
linux arm file -- from archlinuxarm.org -- is in the same directory as this script):

./install-arch.sh /dev/sdb ./ArchLinuxARM-rpi-latest.tar.gz

If you place your wpa_supplicant.conf and/or wlan0.network files in the same directory
as the install-arch.sh script, the script will also copy those to the boot folder,
which will cause them to be active at boot.

Updating WiFi settings:
-----------------------

To set or change your wifi ssid and password that the pi connects to on boot:

wpa_passphrase "YourSSID" "YourWirelessPassword" > wpa_supplicant.conf

(place this wpa_supplicant.conf file onto your pi's boot directory and reboot the pi)

To set a static ip address, or configure other networking features, you can put a file
called wlan0.network, which will override the default profile.
